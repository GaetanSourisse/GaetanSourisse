- 👋 Hi, I’m @GaetanSourisse

- 👀 I’m interested in new technology and astronomy and belote and tiramisu!

- 🌱 I’m a student at Ada Tech School since last October, I'm preparing the title of Designer/Developer of applications and software. We develop multiple team projects in which we approach various languages and tools (Symfony, Laravel, Javascript, React, React Native, Python, Mysql among others). Between these projects we deepen our code culture (clean code, POO, test culture, Agile methodology, cybersecurity, authentication...) independently. We learn to learn, in fact, I can quickly evolve on new stacks.

- 💞️ I’m looking for apprenticeship in Nantes for summer 2023, rythm : 4 days/1 day.

- my skills : empathy, autonomy and ease of learning.
